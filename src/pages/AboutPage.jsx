            We are on a mission to make roads safer through smart, AI-powered traffic violation detection.
            Our system leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning models to automatically detect violations such as:
            <span className="text-yellow-300 font-medium"> Riding without a helmet</span>,
            <span className="text-pink-300 font-medium"> triple riding</span>,
            <span className="text-green-300 font-medium"> using mobile phones while driving</span>,
            <span className="text-red-300 font-medium"> wrong way detection</span> &amp;
            <span className="text-orange-300 font-medium"> breaking signal rules</span>, and more.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Our mission is to reduce traffic violations and accidents by providing real-time detection 
            of unsafe behaviors such as riding without helmets, using phones while driving, 
            triple riding on two-wheelers, and wrong-way driving.
